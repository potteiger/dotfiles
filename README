   I created this dotfiles repository mainly so I can keep
configs on my OpenBSD machines in sync. Stars of the show are
i3(1), alacritty(1), and vim(1). Also included is rofi(1),
redshift(1), and ksh(1).

FILES

   README   -- You're looking at it.
   Makefile -- A Makefile providing targets for selective or bulk
      installation, deletion, or restowing of dotfiles using GNU
      stow(1).

   Remaining files are all dotfiles.

INSTALLATION

   Install all dotfiles:

      make install

Enjoy.
